Hi there!

# What is fs-travelbook

This project was born when some friends told me "Hey, you know what would be really cool? To be able to see all the flight we did with OnAir in Flight Simulator".
As I always like a good challenge, I thought that it could be quite fun to do. [So I did](https://eskimon.fr/fs2020-onair-historymap/).

But then I thought "Why stick to a single page? A proper website to store pictures and all the flights could be even better". So, again, [I did](https://travelbook.eskimon.fr/). And here is the code.

On the website, you can upload your OnAir history flight and attached some pictures to it to see where in the world you have been!

# Install

You can either use my own copy (no tracking and such) at <https://travelbook.eskimon.fr> or run your own. The source code is based on Django and I use npm to build the front.

# Sidenotes

I am not very inspired yet for this README so here is some presentation!

I am a Freelancer based in France.
As I am passionnate by my job, when I am not working for a client I like to take on some fun ideas and challenges.
Maybe some day I'll be able to do it full time, untill then I still need to pay bills and keep the server running to host your flights and pictures.
If you can and want to help, you can sponsor me [on Tipeeee](https://tipeee.com/eskimon)!

Thanks for reading and have fun with this little tool!
